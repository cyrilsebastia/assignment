        <h3>2. Dhoni Waterfalls</h3>
        <p>
            Dhoni is situated around 15 Kilometers from Palakkad town in Kerala, India. Dhoni is named after a boat shaped rock on one of its hill, as boat in Malayalam is called "thoni". It is famous for Dhoni Waterfalls and the Western Ghat forests. Dhoni is bordered by Western Ghats on north. It is also a popular trekking spot for tourists. Dhoni farm is situated at Dhoni.
            Dhoni Waterfalls is located around 15 km from Palakkad and around 34 km from Kollengode Town in Palakkad. An entry pass is required before entering the area. A fee of Rs.100/- (from 15 August 2016) will be charged per person. You have to walk 4 km from the bottom of the hill to reach the waterfalls. The roads are not tarred, and one can see water flowing down between the rocks on the way up. No restrictions for carrying food to the top.
            Upon reaching the top, one can see the lovely view of the waterfalls and enjoy a bath in the cold waters. With a climb up the rocks one can feel the beauty of the jungles and it is said to have leopards, elephants and so. However, encountering them is rare. A 4 km walk can sometimes be dehydrating as it is a humid area and never climb the hill without much rest in between as continuous climbing can make you feel tired and will kill the joy of trekking.
            A three-hour trek from the base of the Dhoni hills will take you to the pristine beauty of nature and the lush green surroundings will rejuvenate your senses. The trekking starts at the foot of the hills near the Teak plantations. A narrow mountain way is there for four-wheel drives and bikes that lead up to the waterfall; however private vehicles are prohibited from traversing these roads. This 4 km long trekking trail through the lush green environs bestows one with a quiet isolated space to witness nature in its most tranquil form. This guided trek is best to start trekking early mornings, so more time can be spent in the company of the gorgeous waterfall. 
            The waterfalls are full during monsoon and it overflows with beautiful small streams gushing down, so the best time to visit is during monsoon (June â€“ October). Bathing in the waterfall is not allowed, though there are places down the stream for bathing. The return journey is comparatively easy lasting usually around 2 hours.
